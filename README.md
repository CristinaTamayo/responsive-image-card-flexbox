## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to do the image responsive and added it within the CSS with the background-image property.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.card-container .product-image {
  background-image: url(../images/image-product-mobile.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to use the mobile-first workflow in future challenges and projects. I also would like to practice with grid instead next time.
